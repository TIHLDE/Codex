## Overview

*Depending on what part of the project you are working on, you will need to set up different 
things.*

For the frontend, there are two main components, the web frontend and the mobile app. The web 
frontend is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), and the mobile app is built using
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

The backend is built using [Django](https://www.django-rest-framework.org), and uses
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as a database. All backend components are bundled with 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
