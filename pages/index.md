## Overview

*Depending on what part of the project you are working on, you will need to set up different 
things.*

For the frontend, there are two main components, the web frontend and the mobile app. The web 
frontend is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), and the mobile app is built using
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

The backend is built using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and uses
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database. All web and backend components are bundled with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Design files are available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

Our main communication channel is [Discord](https://discord.com/), and we use our 
[GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Texicon-AS) for hosting the code and docs, along with 
issue boards and more.
