## Useful prior knowledge
- Linux Commands

## Pre-requisties
- Unix-based Terminal (WSL for Windows)

## Purpose
Although the job of a developer is often to create intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interfaces (GUI), a seasoned digital native tends towards a hands-on-keyboard approach, often using command-line interfaces (CLI). To put it another way, once you get comfortable with keyboard shortcuts and such, you will notice a drastic increase in efficiency. To aid in this process of switching from GUI to CLI, you will learn some of the basic commands for UNIX-based terminals.

At the end of this challenge, you should:
- Be a bit more familiar and confident with using the terminal
- Understand why less clicks is usually better

## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to navigate a text file filled with lots of emails using only a CLI. The challenge consists of three sub-tasks:

1. Find all the `@tihlde.org` emails in the `email-challenge.txt` file.
2. Change all `@hotmail.com` to `@tihlde.org`.

## Bonus Challenge
- Create a new text file with all the users that just changed their email.
