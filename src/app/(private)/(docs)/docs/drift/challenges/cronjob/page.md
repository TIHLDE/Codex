## Difficulty
&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;

## Useful prior knowledge
- Linux commands

## Pre-requisties
- Unix-based Terminal
- Root privileges 

## Purpose
The purpose of this task is to familiarize oneself with scheduled events and triggers. On Unix-based systems, `cron` is a CLI utility that allows for scheduling of jobs. 

At the end of this challenge, you should:
- Understand the usefulness of scheduled jobs
- Have hands-on experience with cron

## Objective
Create a local cron job that echos  `Hello world`  every 2 minutes, using only the cron manual.


## Bonus Challenge
- Set up a simple database (relation or document-based). Then, set up a cron job that creates a database dump once a week. The cron job should also delete a previous dump once it is older than 1 month.

- Set up a cron job that runs Sunday 22:00, retrieves a list of TIHLDE events happening in the coming week, and sends out an email to a specified list of people (could also connect to Discord Bot instead).
