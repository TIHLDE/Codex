## Difficulty
&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;

## Useful prior knowledge
No special knowledge need.

## Pre-requisties
- Git 

## Purpose
Git is one of the most used version control systems for programming. To properly set up and administer applications, a fundamental understanding of coding projects is necessary. The purpose of this challenge is therefore to gain a better understanding of Git and remote storage services such as GitHub or GitLab.

At the end of this challenge, you should:
- Be able to set up a local repo and connect it to a remote repo
- Understand branching and why it is useful
- Become more comfortable with Git CLI commands

## Objective
The main objective for this challenge is to initialize a local repository, add some code to the repository, and push this code to a remote branch. Overall, the following needs to be done:

1. Download Git, if you do not have it downloaded already.
2. Create a GitHub (or GitLab) account.
3. Initialize a local repository
4. Open a remote repository
5. Add code to the local repository.
6. Push the local changes to the remote repository.
7. Create a useful README.md


## Bonus Challenge
- Create a new branch and push this to the remote repository. There should now be two branches in the repository. Get the changes from the new branch into the master (or main) branch. To do so, look into Pull Requests (Merge Request on GitLab).

- Attempt GitHub Actions challenge and integrate into this repository.
