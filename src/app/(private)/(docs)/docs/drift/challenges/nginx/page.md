## Difficulty

&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;

## Useful prior knowledge

- HTTP
- HTML, JS, CSS
- Git

## Pre-requisties

- Nginx

## Purpose

Setting up and administering an HTTP web server encapsulates a significant portion of the fundamentals of Drift. The purpose of this challenge is therefore to further develop basic understanding.

At the end of this challenge, you should:

- Better understanding of HTTP, APIs, endpoints, and ports.
- Learn about Nginx.

## Objective

This challenge is a bit more open than other challenges. The objective is to set up a web server to serve an application. The application can be whatever you desire. Therefore, part of the challenge is setting a personal goal for what you want to get out of this challenge. For example, you may want to create an e-portfolio, focus on the security aspects of serving an application, etc. For this challenge, Nginx is recommended as it is a resource-efficient, open-source web-server. To help narrow down the scope a little bit, here are some general sub-tasks:

1. You will need to create web application (simple static website will do).
2. Download NGINX.
3. Configure NGINX to serve the website on port 80 (or 8080) and with the localhost domain.

## Bonus Challenge

- Buy a domain (pretty cheap for 1 year) and connect domain to web server.
- Set up TLS/SSL certificates for HTTPS communication. Nginx may be used a reverse proxy in this instance.
- Use Nginx as a load balancer.
