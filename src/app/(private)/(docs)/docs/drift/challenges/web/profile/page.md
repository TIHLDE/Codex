   - Include a profile image (use a placeholder image if you don’t have one).
   - Add sections for your name, a short bio, and a few hobbies or interests.
   - Include a list of skills or fun facts (can be unordered or ordered list).

2. CSS Styling:

   - Set a background color for your page.
   - Style the profile image with a circular frame and a small shadow.
   - Add custom fonts (either system fonts or Google Fonts) for your name and headings.
   - Use at least two colors for styling different sections or text.

3. JavaScript Interactivity:
   - Create a "Show More" button below the bio that toggles additional information about you, such as your goals or favorite books/movies.
   - Use JavaScript to display the current date at the bottom of the page.

## Bonus Challenge

- Add an animated effect to your profile image on hover (e.g., slight zoom-in or rotation).
- Display a message with JavaScript that says "Welcome to my page!" when the page loads.
