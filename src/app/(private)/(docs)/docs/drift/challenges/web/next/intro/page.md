## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to help you get started with Next.js. Next.js is a popular React framework that allows you to build server-side rendered React applications with ease. By completing this challenge, you will have a basic understanding of how to set up a Next.js project and create a simple web application. A familiarity with Next.js will be beneficial for future challenges that involve building web applications. The React framework is a popular choice for building web applications, and Next.js is a powerful tool that can help you build web applications quickly and efficiently.

## Objective
In this challenge I will guide you through the process of setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript, ESlint and TailwindCSS.

Run the following command to create a new Next.js project:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-test-app --typescript --eslint
```

You will now be prompted to choose a template. Select the default template by pressing `Enter`.
You should choose the following options when prompted:
- TailwindCSS: Yes
- Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory?: No
- Would you like to use App router?: Yes
- Would you like to use Turbopack for next dev?: Yes
- Would you like to customize the import alias?: No

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd my-test-app
```

You will now have a new Next.js project with TypeScript, ESlint and TailwindCSS set up. You can start the development server by running the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your new Next.js project in action.

You have now completed the challenge! You have successfully set up a Next.js project with TypeScript, ESlint and TailwindCSS. You can now start building your web application using Next.js.
